/**
 * Utility class for browser-related operations in the Task Manager Plus application.
 * 
 * <p>This class provides various utility methods to interact with and manipulate 
 * browser settings and behaviors. It is intended to centralize common browser 
 * operations that can be reused across different test classes.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Example usage:</p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * // Example future method usage
 * BrowserUtils.scrollToElement(driver, element);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p><b>Note:</b> This class should be extended with static methods to perform 
 * common browser actions, such as scrolling, taking screenshots, handling alerts, etc.</p>
